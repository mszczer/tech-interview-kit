# Data Structures and Algorithms Challenges Repository

## Description
This repository contains solutions to various coding problems presented on the [Data Structures and Algorithms Challenges](https://afteracademy.com/tech-interview/ds-algo-problem-set/top-problems/). These challenges are part of Tech Interview Preparation Kit.

## Contents
- Each problem solution is grouped within classes, organized by the problem's description and its respective implementation in C# .NET Core.
- Test suites are included for most of the classes, ensuring the correctness of the solutions.
- The entire codebase is written in C# .NET Core, providing a consistent environment for all solutions.
- Code coverage metrics and Codacy analyses are in place to maintain code quality and readability.
- Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) is configured to automatically run tests and generate detailed reports, making it easier to track code changes and their impacts on the overall codebase.
